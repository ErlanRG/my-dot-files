# Dot files
This repo was created to store my dot-files. Currently .vimrc and .bashrc only.

## .vimrc
1. Install vim or nvim (if you decided to switch from vim and want to use the
.vimrc, wou will need to set the runtime path in you init.vim file. Read the
nvim documentation for more info).

2. To make it easier, first install vim-plug manager:
    * https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug

3. Download the latest version of the vimrc and copy it into your home directory.
4. Change its name to .vimrc

### Some of the plygins I use:
    * Gruvbox
    * vim-fugitive
    * Bracey
    * YouCompleteMe (not active here since I'm having issues with the installng on the RPi)
    * Syntastic (not active)
    * vim-indent-guides
    * vim-airline / vim-airline-themes

## .bashrc
Haven't done anything cool with this file yet. New things coming up.

If you get to see this repo, feel free to contribute and make vim a better place to code.
Just make sure that there is no other similar addition to the one you are making :)

Kind of new in the github community, so any advice would be well appreciated.
