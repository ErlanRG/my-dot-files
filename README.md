# Dot files

This repo was created to store my dotfiles. 

## .vimrc

1. If you are using VIM as your main text editor, just copy the .vimrc files
to your home directory.
If you are using NVIM, first create the config directory for NVIM 
(~/.config/nvim if you haven't already) and copy the init.vim file and then 
copy the .vimrc file to your home directory

2. The plugin manager and the missing plugins will be installed automatically

## .zshrc
1. Install zsh and set it as your main shell.
2. Install oh-my-zsh
3. Copy the .zshrc to your home directory
